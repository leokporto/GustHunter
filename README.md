Gust Hunter is a repository to learn .Net Blazor by  developing a weather app for sailors

It's an application that can provide real-time weather data and forecasts specifically tailored for sailors.

## Features

**Weather Data Service**: Fetches and updates weather data from an external API (OpenWeatherMap). It should provide information like wind speed and direction, wave height, tide information, temperature, and other weather conditions that are important for sailing.

**User Profile Service**: This service manages user data, including their preferred locations for sailing, notification preferences, and other personal settings.

**Location Management Service**: This service handles location data, allowing users to search for and save their favorite locations. It could also provide location-based weather forecasts.

**Authentication Service**: This service handles user registration and login. It ensures that user data is secure and that only authenticated users can access certain features.
